	<h2>About</h2>
 	<p>This is the site of Richard Careaga&rsquo;s consulting practice in the pragmatic analysis of the problems of businesses and and non-profit organizations.</p>
<h2 id="whats-pragmatic">What&rsquo;s pragmatic?</h2>
	<p>Not every solution has an appropriate problem. <em>Pragmatic</em> analysis begins with thoroughly understanding the problem in need of a solution.</p>
	<p>Not every problem requires the tools of massive data processing and machine learning. Not every problem can be solved by back of the envelope tools, either.</p>
<h2 id="pragmatic-analysis">Pragmatic analysis</h2>
	<p>A <em>pragmatic</em> analysis matches the solution to the right problem.</p>
	<p>Understanding the problem is the challenging. Some problems are difficult only because they are embedded in histories of workarounds, casual decisions and <a href="ideas.html#carbon_set">unnoticed changes</a>. And some problems appear simple only because they fail to address side effects on other processes.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Science is what we understand well enough to explain to a computer. Art is everything else we do. <em>Donald Knuth</em></p>
</blockquote>
	<p>So, it starts with art, understanding the problem well enough to know how to break it down into programmable pieces.</p>
	<h2 id="price">Price</h2>
	<p>At the completion of an engagement comes a single-item invoice representing an estimate of the value of the work. The client can accept the value or propose a different value. If agreement cannot be reached, the invoice is withdrawn and the relationship ends. I do not bill on an hourly fee or other effort basis.</p>
