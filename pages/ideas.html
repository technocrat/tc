	<h2 class="article-title">We&#39;ve just remembered why we always have done it this way</h1>
 	<p>In the late 1990s I worked as a public utilities regulator in California. Every week I would receive a dozen copies of documents ranging from a single sheet to thick stacks. After setting aside a few copies for various purposes eight were sent to recycling.</p>
	<p>Finally, I asked:</p>
	<blockquote>
	<p>Why 12 copies?</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>No one seemed to know until someone thought to ask the most senior clerk. She said</p>
	<blockquote>
	<p>That&rsquo;s the most copies that you can type with a carbon-set</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>The carbon-set was a stack of alternating typing paper and carbon paper used to produce copies on typewriters. It predated office copiers. Like the two-space after a period rule, the technology&rsquo;s influence lasted far longer than the technology itself.</p>
	<p>More business processes than we might care to admit to ourselves have similar rationales. Recognizing and rationalizing them can lead to quicker, simpler solutions to more important problems that are ensnared by forgotten history.</p>
